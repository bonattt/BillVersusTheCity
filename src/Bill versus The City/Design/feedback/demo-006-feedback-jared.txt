- can switch while fully aimed with handgun to aim rifle faster
- should be able to reload while aimed
- change player and enemy damage sounds to not be the same
- enemy can see through car, but not shoot through car


FEEDBACK
- maybe rifle aiming takes a LITTLE too long?
- reason to use rifle shouldn't be trying to look further down a corridore
- slightly frustrated by not seeing people Bill should be able to see
- slow aim is a debuff to trying to look how a person would look

- split camera aim and accuracy aim, and add cone showing accuracy of shooting???
- MUCH BETTER --> look in a direction without aiming
