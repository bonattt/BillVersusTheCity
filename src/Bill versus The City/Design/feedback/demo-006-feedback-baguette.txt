BAGUETTE

different resolutions are different
couldn't shoot
confused by not starting with handgun equipped

sneak around back isn't clear in tutorial 2

while shooting at an enemy, the mouse happened to be over quit game button. when the popup appeared, baguette shot it and exited out.

enemies can be cheesed by getting them stuck on corners

confused by shotgun reloading one shell at a time --> figured it out after a little while

unresponsive death animations are very confusing

felt like there was a delay when shooting. (maybe due to sprinting when trying to shoot??)

Level 1: always misses the one enemy below in the penultimate room

did not realize you could shoot without aiming

using shotgun at beyond optimal range


FEEDBACK FROM BAGUETTE:
- bullet travel time is maybe too slow
- shoot enemies and they still shoot you and die
