Interaction: hit E to switch weapons, got the speak action instead

	- still don't like the mouse to interact, even when highlighting is working

- change text for the pickup weapon that actually swaps weapons
- weapon pickups can block each other
- enemies get really close before shooting
- the middle of the fence can be crawled over
- can shoot through the wall while crouched
- camera jitter
- aiming line isn't blocked by the truck
- aim line is short when mouse is near the player, maybe
- enemies cannot spot you from long distance, but can shoot you if they're hostile, and can keep track of you at a longer distance
- check if enemy is actually on screen before INITIATING hostility, but allow enemies to still shoot from further off screen if already hostile
- can `escape` out of weapon select and death menus
