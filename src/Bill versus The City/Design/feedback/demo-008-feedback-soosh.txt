Soosh was having errors trying to name save files
"rename just doesn't work"

"still doesn't like evil velocity"

can aim while in non-combat mode

only one gun range works, and that was confusing

change "exit game" in pause menu to "return to main menu"

level 1 still says "defeat all enemies to leave" no matter what the 

level 2 still too hard
