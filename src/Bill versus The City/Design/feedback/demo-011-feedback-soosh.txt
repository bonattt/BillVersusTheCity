- menun has no back button
- pickup UI blocks vision of the player
- picking up a gun with nothing equipped should auto switch to the new weapon
- cooking grenade looks like "charging the throw"
- throwing too close to the fence bounces off and kills the player
- enemies will kill each other 
- grenade explosion size is very unintuitive
