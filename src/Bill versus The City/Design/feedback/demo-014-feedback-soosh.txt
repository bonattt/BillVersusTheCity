- the main menu has too much stuff
- broken timer was present in objectives on tutorial 1
- i wish the volume would change as I slide around
- tutorial got too wordy
- crouch and dive being the same button is confusing o:
- soosh thinks the enemies with SMGs can shoot too long before reloading, and people will die uncrouching
- need to remove weapon drops for enemies in cover tutorial 
- soosh got the bug where, on restard, PC is invisible, and can walk through walls... I had this once and can't reproduce it.
- did not realize there was a police timer
- time limit seemed tight
- invisible wall almost got me killed 
- allways backs out of the house to fight the first wave of guys
