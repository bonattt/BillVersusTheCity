# Legal Case Plot Thread
### Part 1

    at which point he is been billed for 10 days already ($2500)
- on the phone, the woman mentions she checked on google maps, and the lawn is still not mowed. 

### Part 2
- once bill gets off the phone, he immediately gets caught talking to Ol' Dave, and Ol' Dave tells him to call his (Ol' Dave's) lawyer
- Bill meets Ol' Dave's lawyer. The lawyer says they are technically following the law, since a tiny patch of the lawn was unmowed; 
    however, he thinks they can maybe make a constitutional case over the severity of penalty under the 4th ammendment, against 
    "unreasonable searches and seizures"
    - the lawyer also suggests, contacting the press and making bad PR for them over this, and gives Bill a number

    consults his lawyer about it. 
    - The Journalist investigates this, and finds out about the shady holding company that the city government is involved in
    - The Cop warns Bill the Police Chief is after him

- Bill steals a private email server to get proof the city government is in on the whole thing
    - bill breaks into the mayor's private house, and steals an email server
    - a swat team shows up almost immedately, and bill needs to escape quickly
