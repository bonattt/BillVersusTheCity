# CONFLICT WITH EX-WIFE
- AGREEABLENESS:
- OPENNESS: neither is especially open, they are compatible here
- EXTRAVERSION: bill doesn't talk about things much, and doesn't like going out; his ex-wife thinks he bottles things up, and has to drag him out.
- CONSCIENTIOUSNESS: bill is a bit messy and impulsive, and his wife cannot stand this
- NEUROTICISM: bill is low neuroticism, and simply doesn't see a problem where his Ex-wife is upset
