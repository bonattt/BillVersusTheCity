    Motivation: 
Srg. Jensen is a career police officer. He's married, and recently had his first kid; at the start of the story. 
Early in his career, he was bright-eyed and idealistic, and used to study philosophy as a hoby. At present, he is disillusion with the police, and is more focused on career, personal, safety and supporting his family. He knows the city police are corrupt, and has been keeping his head down about it.
Over the course of the story, he rekindles his vision, and he begins to have a strong desire to clean up the corruption in the city police.
