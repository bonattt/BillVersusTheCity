`Events` in this context is mainly refering to IGameEventEffect, (originally called IGameEvent) which is a genetic interface for defining
reusable effects that can be triggered by other scripts. Strictly speaking, they're not events, however, the term `Effects` is already in use to 
refer to visial effects and other non-mechanical aesthetic effects, such as particles or sound effects.
