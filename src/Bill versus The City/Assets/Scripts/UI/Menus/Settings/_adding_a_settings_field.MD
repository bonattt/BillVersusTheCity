## For standardized field types (int, float, bool)
1) add the field as a string to the appropriate field_names field in the concrete class that implements `AbstractSettingsModule`
1) add the field to the UI Document in `Initialize` in the concrete class that implements `AbstractSettingsModuleMenu`

## For non-standardized fields
- TODO
